    <h2>About CodeUnity</h2>
    <p>CodeUnity is a student-driven initiative that brings together young minds to explore coding and collaborate through mentorship. It’s not just an organization—it’s a movement of students who believe that tech should empower, connect, and uplift. Through online programs, in-person workshops, and inspiring guest speakers, CodeUnity creates spaces where learners become leaders and coders become change makers...</p>
    <p>Our slogan, “Code Together. Grow Together,” sums it up beautifully, because every project, workshop, and mentorship experience is designed not just to build skills, but to build character, so that one day, the participants will be able to use their skills to help change the world.</p>
